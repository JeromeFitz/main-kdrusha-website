## KD Rusha Main Website


First website that I integrated the Soundcloud, YouTube, and Instagram API. I give credit to [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/), Name Here, and Name Here to whom I learned how to integrated them into my web applications.





Please note: NO Soundcloud, Instagram, and Youtube API's key is present in auth.js. If you wish to see the app in action, you'll have to generate your own keys at [Google](https://console.developers.google.com), [SoundCloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) websites.


## Get Started

```
git clone https://github.com/fromcortes/main-kdrusha-website.git
cd mocha
npm install (first time only)
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.


## Dependencies

Currently requires knowledge of:
- HTML
- SASS
- JavaScript (ES2016+)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react)
